A set of widgets for creating scripture apps.

## Features

- Replaces the Flutter `Text` widget for displaying and interacting with text.
- Text is divided into units so that words and verses can be tapped or long pressed.

## Getting started

Break your text into words and give each word an ID, verse number, chapter number and book number.

## Usage

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## A request to Bible app makers

Are you making an app where the biblical text is under copyright? Suggest to the copyright owner that they release it to the public domain. Read [*The Bondage of the Word: Copyright and the Bible*](https://sellingjesus.org/articles/copyright-and-the-bible#other-modern-translations) for some good reasons why.

Paywalls and ads hinder people from reading God's word. Consider [other funding options](https://copy.church/explain/funding/) instead.

## License

The code in this package is dedicated to the public domain (CC0).
